# GE11VFAT_Geometry
The code already contains a working example.

One can either plot a single chamber partitioned per VFAT with the function ```PlotGE11ChamberVFAT``` or a whole GE11 wheel with the function ```PlotGE11VFATWheel```.
```endcapTAG``` specifies which GE11 wheel to draw (i.e. ML1 for Minus Layer 1).
